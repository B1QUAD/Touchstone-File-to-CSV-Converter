# Touchstone-File-to-CSV-Converter
This is a very simple java program that converts touchstone (.s1p, and .s2p) files to .csv format (excel/open office readable).
The touchstoneConverter.jar file is a very basic gui which interfaces with the converter.java file made as a quick demo to show how the conversion works.
Feel free to modify and use this source code in your projects.
